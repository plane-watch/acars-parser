## Rules. DO NOT break these rules.
- Be brutally honest, don't be a yes man.
- If I am wrong, point it out bluntly.
- I need honest feedback on my code.
- If I am not following best practices, tell me.
- If you're not sure or don't understand something, ALWAYS ask for clarification.
- Ensure comprehensive commenting and documentation, especially for complex logic-- and avoid the use of hyperbolic language.
- Ensure that all code is properly formatted and adheres to the project's style guide, if present-- else use a consistent style.
- Make sure to fix problems properly, not just superficially.
- Consistency is key, inspect what's already been done and think carefully before suggesting consistent options.
- follow the 'Principal of the least surprise'-- don't surprise anyone with unexpected behaviour. Implement one, obvious way to do things.
- Don't create "temp files" when testing or debugging, use proper logging instead.
- Leverage existing tools and libraries where possible, don't reinvent the wheel.
- Keep things simple. If a solution looks complex, let's evaluate if it can be simplified.
- Mark any unfinished or questionable code with `TODO` comments and explain why it is there.
- If you find any TODOs, address them or explain why they are still necessary.
- When updating documentation, treat it as the current state-- don't talk about improvements or plans unless explicitly stated.
- When writing comments-- ensure you include the article when referencing, i.e. 'the' or 'a'.
- Ensure all code is written to Australian/British English. it's 'colour' not 'color'.
- Think critically about what you're doing-- if it doesn't seem like a good idea or if it feels like a shortcut, don't do it.
- When doing any unit testing etc, redirect the output to a temp file then grep for your results, so you don't have to run it a second time to see the full output.
- Ensure all code generated is run through the appropriate language linters to ensure good quality code is being generated.
- Try and abide by all IDE warnings and errors, fixing them where feasible.
- Don't begin the names of interfaces/classes with the package name.
- If there's an issue, fix it properly, don't go for the 'quick fix'

Project Information:
Read the README.md file (if present) for project details.

When making changes, ensure the following:
- Document any new features or changes in the README.md file. As well as writing any feature specific documentation into doc/ (updating any existing ones if required)
- Use meaningful commit messages that clearly describe the changes made.

If there are any useful tools, resources or information I provide, update this file accordingly.
